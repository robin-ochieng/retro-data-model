# Field Map (Business Reference)

Keep these files in sync when fields or tabs change:
- docs/field-map.json (detailed schema for storage and payloads)
- docs/field-map-slim.json (Excel column mapping for n8n)
- docs/field-map.md (this descriptive guide)

If you add or remove fields/tabs, update all three files. I can automate this syncing if we centralize field definitions in code and add a script to regenerate the docsâ€”tell me if you want that next.
